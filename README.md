# Cancer Genomics NGS Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end, production-style pipeline for analyzing cancer genomics NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) data. It demonstrates best practices in pipeline engineering, software reproducibility, and translational insight, using public (or synthetic) NGS data for privacy.

Designed for both engineering and scientific audiences, the project includes:

- Quality Control and analysis of DNA & RNA sequencing data
- Variant calling (SNVs, indels), differential expression, and integrated reporting
- Modular and scalable pipeline management using Nextflow and Docker
- Cloud-ready (AWS Batch/S3) configurations
- Robust coding standards: version control, unit testing, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Well-documented Jupyter notebooks for reproducible research and visualization

## How To Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cancer-Genomics-NGS-Pipeline.git
cd Cancer-Genomics-NGS-Pipeline


2. **Build Docker Image (for reproducibility)**
docker build -t cancer-ngs-pipeline pipelines/


3. **Run Nextflow Pipeline (local test run)**
nextflow run pipelines/main.nf -profile docker


4. **Explore Results**
- See notebook(s) in `notebooks/` for visualization and biological interpretation.
- Check the `reports/` directory for summary outputs and logs.

5. **Cloud Use**
- Edit `nextflow.config` for your AWS/S3/Batch setup and run:

nextflow run pipelines/main.nf -profile aws


## Requirements

- Docker
- Nextflow
- Python 3.9+
- Required Python packages listed in `/scripts/requirements.txt`

## Project Highlights

- All core scripts are modular and unit tested (see `tests/` directory)
- Example data is synthetic and small for testing/demo purposes
- Jupyter notebooks illustrate full analysis and interpretation pipeline
- Designed for extension to clinical or large-cohort data in a secure environment
